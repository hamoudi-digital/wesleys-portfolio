                            <br />
                            <p>Wes Lewis is a saxophonist, composer, and arranger based in New Haven, CT. He studied under multiple Grammy award winning musicians including Wayne Escoffery, Abraham Burton, and George Caldwell. Arriving in New Haven CT in 2019, Wes has quickly made a name for himself via performances with the Yale School of Music, and as a principal member of the Yale Jazz Initiative groups, including the Yale Jazz Ensemble and Yale Jazz Combos. In 2023, Wes performed Charles Mingus’ behemoth composition, Epitaph, alongside the Mingus Big Band and select Yale students, and under the direction of Kuumba Frank Lacy and Wayne Escoffery. Other recent cornerstones of Wes’ musical achievement include performances at Dizzy’s (Jazz at Lincoln Center) featuring tenor saxophone giant George Coleman as well as a series of sound baths commissioned by NXTHVN, the gallery founded by artist and MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship recipient Titus Kaphar.</p>
                            <p>In 13 years of performing professionally, Wes has played at an array of public and private venues in the Connecticut, Rhode Island, NYC, and Western NY jazz scenes, including Woolsey Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, RD86 Space, NXTHVN, Cafe 9, The State House, Oasis Pub, News Cafe, Jack’s Bar and Steakhouse, Kokomo’s, Redscroll Records, Lewiston Jazz Festival, and others.</p>
                            <p>Alongside the Yale ensembles, Wes frequently performs with Trance Macabre, a collective dedicated to advancing avant garde musics through collective composition. Founded by bassist and sculptor Nicholas Serrambana, Trance Macabre features a slew of up-and-coming musicians including Vigilence Brandon, Cameron Campbell, Ryan Sands, Michael Larocca, and Autumn Asbridge. He also leads the Wes Lewis Quartet, which is made up of Derek Lewis on piano, Conway Campbell Jr. and Zwelakhe-Duma Bell Le Pere on bass, and Ryan Sands on drums. Leading into Summer of 2023, Wes is also working on original compositions to debut with Ryan Sands’ forthcoming sextet, as well as a suite of pieces for the the Wes Lewis Digital Combo, which is a neo-soul group that debuted at The State House in February 2023.</p>
                            <p>Wes initially began studying saxophone in fourth grade before eventually performing with the award-winning SHCHS Jazz Ensemble and co-founding the Luke Ciminelli Quintet and Small Combo at the age of 14. He then served as 1st Tenor Saxophone for the University at Buffalo Big Bands from 2014-2015, before touring Europe within a concert band for American Music Abroad in late 2015. After absorbing a much more expansive scope of jazz music as an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester, Wes moved to New Haven to pursue further musical opportunities alongside a PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) at Yale in 2019. In the future, Wes aims to find further success as a jazz and contemporary saxophonist while incorporating the techniques and perspectives that fields such as machine learning and algorithm development lend to his musical and compositional approach.</p>
